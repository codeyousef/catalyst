# Catalyst IDE Changes Log

This document tracks all modifications made to transform Catalyst into Catalyst IDE, following the implementation plan in `docs/private/catalyst-ide.md`.

## Phase 0: Test Infrastructure Setup ✓ COMPLETED

### Day 1: Test Framework Foundation ✓ COMPLETED
- [x] Created test directory structure at `/tests`
- [x] Added Rust test configuration using criterion
- [x] Created test runner structure in Cargo.toml  
- [x] Set up performance benchmark framework
- [x] Created test coverage infrastructure

### Day 2: Performance Testing Infrastructure ✓ COMPLETED  
- [x] Created performance benchmark directory at `/tests/performance`
- [x] Wrote startup time measurement test (TDD - currently failing)
- [x] Wrote memory usage tracking test (< 40MB idle requirement)
- [x] Created binary size verification test (< 5MB requirement)
- [x] Set up automated performance regression detection

### Day 3: MCP and Integration Testing ✓ COMPLETED
- [x] Created MCP test directory at `/tests/mcp`
- [x] Defined all 15+ required MCP servers
- [x] Created MCP server connectivity test framework
- [x] Set up MCP protocol compliance test structure
- [x] Created integration test framework

## Phase 1: Catalyst Fork Preparation 🔄 IN PROGRESS

### Day 4: Fork and Initial Setup 🔄 IN PROGRESS
- [x] Renamed main package from "catalyst" to "catalyst" in root Cargo.toml
- [x] Updated binary names (catalyst, catalyst-proxy) 
- [x] Renamed binary files (catalyst.rs → catalyst.rs, catalyst-proxy.rs → catalyst-proxy.rs)
- [x] Updated homepage to catalyst-ide.dev
- [x] Added testing dependencies (criterion, rstest)
- [x] Created CATALYST_CHANGES.md tracking document
- [ ] Update all package references throughout workspace
- [ ] Update README.md and documentation references
- [ ] Set up development environment verification
- [ ] Verify existing Catalyst tests still pass
- [ ] Create baseline performance measurements

### Changes Made So Far:

#### File Renames:
- `catalyst-app/src/bin/catalyst.rs` → `catalyst-app/src/bin/catalyst.rs`
- `catalyst-proxy/src/bin/catalyst-proxy.rs` → `catalyst-proxy/src/bin/catalyst-proxy.rs`

#### Cargo.toml Updates:
```toml
# Root package name
name = "catalyst" (was "catalyst")
default-run = "catalyst" (was "catalyst")
homepage = "https://catalyst-ide.dev" (was "https://catalyst.dev")

# Binary configurations
[[bin]]
name = "catalyst" (was "catalyst") 
path = "catalyst-app/src/bin/catalyst.rs" (was "catalyst.rs")

[[bin]]
name = "catalyst-proxy" (was "catalyst-proxy")
path = "catalyst-proxy/src/bin/catalyst-proxy.rs" (was "catalyst-proxy.rs")

# Added testing dependencies
criterion = { version = "0.5", features = ["html_reports"] }
rstest = { version = "0.21" }
```

#### Test Infrastructure:
- Complete test directory structure at `/tests/`
- Performance testing framework with strict thresholds:
  - Startup: < 500ms cold, < 200ms warm  
  - Memory: < 40MB idle
  - Binary: < 5MB
- MCP server integration test framework for 15+ servers
- TDD approach with initially failing tests

## Next Steps:
1. Continue workspace package reference updates
2. Update documentation and README
3. Create baseline performance measurements
4. Document architecture for Claude integration points
5. Begin Phase 2: Claude Authentication Foundation

## Testing Status:
- ✅ Test infrastructure complete
- ⚠️  Performance tests currently failing (expected for TDD)
- ⚠️  MCP server tests failing (servers not installed yet)
- 🔄 Working on making workspace consistent

## Build Status:
- Binary names updated but may need cargo clean and rebuild
- Workspace members still reference original Catalyst names
- Need to verify all references are updated before proceeding
