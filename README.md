> **Catalyst is a fork of [Lapce](https://github.com/lapce/lapce)** - enhanced with performance improvements and an extensible plugin architecture for modern development workflows.

Catalyst IDE is written in pure Rust, with a UI in [Floem](https://github.com/lapce/floem). It is designed with [Rope Science](https://xi-editor.io/docs/rope_science_00.html) from the [Xi-Editor](https://github.com/xi-editor/xi-editor), enabling lightning-fast computation, and leverages [wgpu](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu) for rendering.

## ðŸš€ What Makes Catalyst Different

Catalyst builds upon the excellent Lapce foundation with focused improvements:

### âš¡ Performance Optimizations
- **Faster startup times** - Optimized initialization sequence
- **Reduced memory usage** - Efficient resource management
- **Smaller binary size** - Streamlined build process
- **Improved responsiveness** - Enhanced UI performance

### ðŸ”Œ Extensible Architecture
- **Enhanced plugin system** - Support for external integrations
- **Flexible assistant interface** - Generic AI/tool integration capability
- **Modular design** - Clean separation of concerns
- **Future-ready** - Built for extensibility and growth

## Features

* **Built-in LSP ([Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/)) support** for intelligent code features
* **Modal editing support** as first class citizen (Vim-like, and toggleable)
* **Built-in remote development** support inspired by [VSCode Remote Development](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/remote-overview)
* **WASI Plugin system** - Plugins can be written in programming languages that compile to [WASI](https://wasi.dev/) format (C, Rust, [AssemblyScript](https://www.assemblyscript.org/))
* **Built-in terminal** for workspace command execution
* **Extensible architecture** - Support for external integrations and assistant providers
