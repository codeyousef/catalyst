> **ðŸ”¥ Catalyst IDE is a fork of [Lapce](https://github.com/lapce/lapce)** - enhanced with Claude AI integration and 15+ pre-integrated MCP servers for supercharged development workflows.

Catalyst IDE is written in pure Rust, with a UI in [Floem](https://github.com/lapce/floem). It is designed with [Rope Science](https://xi-editor.io/docs/rope_science_00.html) from the [Xi-Editor](https://github.com/xi-editor/xi-editor), enabling lightning-fast computation, and leverages [wgpu](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu) for rendering.

## ðŸš€ What Makes Catalyst Different

Catalyst extends the excellent Lapce foundation with AI-first development tools:

### ðŸ¤– Claude AI Integration
- **Native Claude sidebar** - Chat with Claude directly in your IDE
- **Code-aware conversations** - Claude understands your current project context
- **Intelligent code assistance** - Generate, refactor, and debug code with AI help
- **Multi-language support** - Works seamlessly across all programming languages

### ðŸ”Œ 15+ Pre-integrated MCP Servers
Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers provide Claude with powerful capabilities:
- **filesystem** - Secure file operations with permission management
- **git** - Local Git repository operations
- **github** - GitHub API integration for repos, issues, PRs
- **docker** - Container and image management
- **sentry** - Production error monitoring and debugging
- **socket** - Security analysis for dependencies
- **semgrep** - Static code analysis for vulnerabilities
- **jam** - Debug recordings with video and logs
- **puppeteer** & **playwright** - Browser automation for testing
- **postgresql** - Read-only database queries and schema inspection
- **mindsdb** - Unified interface to vector databases
- **google-drive** - File search and management
- **zapier** - Connect to 8,000+ applications
- **pipedream** - Access to thousands of APIs

### âš¡ Performance-First
- **< 500ms cold start** - Get coding faster
- **< 200ms warm start** - Near-instant project switching  
- **< 40MB idle memory** - Lightweight resource usage
- **< 5MB binary size** - Minimal disk footprint

## Features

* **ðŸ¤– AI-powered development** with native Claude integration
* **ðŸ”Œ 15+ MCP servers** providing Claude with powerful tools and APIs
* Built-in LSP ([Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/)) support for intelligent code features
* Modal editing support as first class citizen (Vim-like, and toggleable)
* Built-in remote development support inspired by [VSCode Remote Development](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/remote-overview)
* Plugins can be written in programming languages that compile to [WASI](https://wasi.dev/) format (C, Rust, [AssemblyScript](https://www.assemblyscript.org/))
* Built-in terminal for workspace command execution

## Installation

You can find pre-built releases for Windows, Linux and macOS [here](https://github.com/catalyst-ide/catalyst/releases), or [installing with a package manager](docs/installing-with-package-manager.md).
